#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is a branch of computer science that invovles the systematic application of engineering principles, 
  methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
  It's importance in technology industry include playing a crucial role by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative
  software solutions that meet user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The development of programming languages e.g., Fortran, C
  The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
  The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
  The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements: this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  Design: this involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  Implementation: this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  Testing: this involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  Deployment: this involves releasing the software to users or customers.
  Maintenance: this involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Feature                                    Waterfall                                        Agile
  Approach                                   Linear and sequential                            Iterative and incremental
  Flexibility                                Rigid; changes are difficult to implement        Highly flexible; allows for continuous feedback and changes
  Project Phases                             Defined phases: Requirements -> Design ->        Cycles of sprints or iterations, with overlapping development and feedback phases
                                             Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> 
                                             Maintenance
  Documentation                              Heavy documentation upfront                       Light documentation, focuses more on working software
  Client Involvement                         Limited, mostly at the beginning and end          Continuous involvement throughout the process
  Risk Management                            High risk if requirements are incorrect or 
                                             change later
  Delivery                                   Delivered at the end of the project               Continuous delivery in iterations
  Best Suited For                            Well-defined, stable projects with clear          Dynamic projects where requirements may evolve
                                             requirements

  When to Use Waterfall:
  1.Regulated Industries – Industries like healthcare, aerospace, or banking where strict compliance and documentation are required.
  2.Construction & Manufacturing – Projects where changes are costly once implementation starts.
  3.Fixed-Price Contracts – Projects with clear deliverables and timelines, such as government contracts.

  Example:
  A government IT infrastructure project where compliance with specific regulations is critical, and all requirements must be defined upfront.

  When to Use Agile:
  1.Software Development Startups – When frequent changes and fast iterations are needed based on user feedback.
  2.Customer-Focused Products – Projects requiring continuous improvement and user involvement, such as mobile apps.
  3.Unclear or Evolving Requirements – When clients or stakeholders may change requirements frequently.

  Example:
  Developing a mobile banking app where user feedback determines new features, requiring continuous updates and iterations.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of      project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development 
  process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
  Prompt engineering helps making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague question: Tell me about cats
  Clear, specific and concise: Tell me about the history of domestic cats
